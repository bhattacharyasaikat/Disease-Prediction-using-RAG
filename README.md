# Disease Prediction using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## To run:
- pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt
- flask -app app run

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered platform to predict diseases based on user symptoms. By utilizing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, the system enhances accuracy by combining retrieval and generation methods.

## Features
- **Symptom-based Disease Prediction**: Input symptoms to get predictions of possible diseases.
- **High Accuracy**: Combines retrieval and generation for better prediction accuracy.
## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **LangChain**
- **Google Gemini Pro**
- **ChromaDB**
- **Flask**
